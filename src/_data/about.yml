    BAMF was born in 2016 out of both a strong desire to do something significant and
    out of an unfortunate tragedy. James knew that he could do the work he was doing for other
    contractors with higher quality and lower costs. He simply knew he could do better. Then,
    James became even more serious about starting his business after his cousin lost his battle
    with leukemia. He had received much of his training from his cousin, a person who was very
    special to him. That was the final push. After much prayer, planning, and hard work, James and
    Courtney made the move of opening the business. … And they haven’t looked back.
